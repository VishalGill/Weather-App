# Description of Project
I created a Weather App that gets you current weather conditions so you are able to see the weather in your location or anywhere around the world. You are able to fetch the information by city name or zip code. I've also implemented a 5 day forecast so you know what type of weather is coming up. Enjoy!

# Unsolved problems/Major hurdles I had to over come:

Unsolved Problems:
- I wasn't able to implement clipArt for the type of weather - will revisit.
- I wasn't able to give user options between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Major Hurdles:
- I wasn't able to find an API that allowed to fetch weather by city directly so I had to fetch the location key of the city and then using that key had to fetch the weather info for the city originally searched.
- Time Management AGAIN - Even when I was ahead I feel like there is never enough time to get your project to where you want it to be. I will try to do a better job of this next project.
- Ran into alot of bugs when trying to implement Clipart.
